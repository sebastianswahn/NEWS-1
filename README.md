# NEWS-1

This app is created to simplify and save time in health-care assessment of patients using the NEWS (National Early Warning Score). Its comming from something i noticed working in the hospital, where this score is counted manually after assesing patients, and for each time you need to manually write down or check the journal to see how the last score was. With this application using the NEWS system becomes more time-efficient and easier. It also reduces the risk of human error, by removing the risk of miscalculation. (Please note that the application is being created right now, its not finished.
